## Endangered
Adventure game about an animal thats on the endangered list seeking for oasis and repopulate in a safe haven.

### Game link
https://hengyuni.github.io/projectOne/endangered/

### Approach
Created two classes for protaganist and antaganists. set a function for each round. use dom manipulation to add text and background for each round.

### Attempts
Tried adding animated fighting gifs to set an adventure line, but failed. will work on it more as the cohorts go by.

### Methods Used
DOM
JS Functions
Class
Objects
Array methods

### Technologies used
MacBook Pro
Node.js
Homebrew
HTML
CSS
Javascript

### Conclusions
Though there is still more bells and whistles I could've added, I feel good for what I was able to do for my skill level. I will be updating it through out the cohort before its portfolio ready.
